# John's Atom Workarounds

This plugin fixes issues that I know about in the Atom editor.

I love Atom, but could not live with the issues when working on my code ...
So I created this plugin most of the issues I had have been solved.

So currently, other than the added fonts ...
The main issues fixed by this plugin are :

+ Bundled fonts have issues with their alignment

In addition this plugin bundles my favorite free fonts :

| In settings | Will map to |
| --- | --- |
|anonymous|AnonymousPro-Regular|
|dejavu|DejaVuSansMono|
|inconsolata|Inconsolata-Regular|
|liberation|LiberationMono-Regular|
|monofur|Monofur|
|pt|PT_Mono|
|srcpro|SourceCodePro-Regular|
|srcpro light|SourceCodePro-Light|
|ubuntu|UbuntuMono-Regular|

Hopefully someone finds this useful :-)
