# John's Atom Workarounds

This plugin fixes issues that I know about in the Atom editor.

I enjoy using it, but could not live with the issues when working on my code.

Currently the main issues fixed by this plugin are :

* The JavaScript language package was unreliable for me.
* Bundled fonts has issues with their alignment

In addition this plugin bundles the following fonts :

+ DejaVuSans Mono
+ Liberation Mono

Hopefully these workarounds help someone else.
