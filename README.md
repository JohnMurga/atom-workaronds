# John's Atom Workarounds

I love Atom, but could not live with the issues while working on my code.  
So I created this plugin to solve most of the issues I have in one place.

Most things get fixed, so now it just does the following :

+ Bundle my favorite fonts for whatever environment I use Atom in.
+ Fix intermittent issues with font alignment.
+ Backups my Atom config.

My bundled fonts are as follows :

| In settings | Will map to |
| --- | --- |
|camingo|CamingoCode|
|courier prime|Courier Prime Source|
|cutive|Cutive Mono|
|hack|Hack|
|inconsolata|Inconsolata-Regular|
|liberation|LiberationMono-Regular|
|pt|PT_Mono|
|roboto-normal|Roboto Mono|
|roboto-light|Roboto Mono Light|
|roboto-thin|Roboto Mono Thin|
|srcpro|SourceCodePro-Regular|
|ubuntu|UbuntuMono-Regular|

Maybe someone else finds this useful

Thanks for reading :smiley:
