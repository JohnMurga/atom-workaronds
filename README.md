# John's Atom Workarounds

This plugin fixes issues that I know about in the Atom editor.

I enjoy using it, but could not live with the issues when working on my code ...
Since I created this plugin most of the issues I had have been solved.

So currently the main issues fixed by this plugin are :

+ Bundled fonts have issues with their alignment

In addition this plugin bundles the following fonts :

+ anonymous -> AnonymousPro-Regular
+ dejavu -> DejaVuSansMono
+ inconsolata -> Inconsolata-Regular
+ liberation -> LiberationMono-Regular
+ monofur -> Monofur
+ pt -> PT_Mono
+ srcpro -> SourceCodePro-Regular
+ srcpro light -> SourceCodePro-Light
+ ubuntu -> UbuntuMono-Regular

Hopefully these workarounds help someone else.
