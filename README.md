# John's Atom Workarounds

I love Atom, but could not live with the issues while working on my code.  
So I created this plugin to solve most of the issues I have in one place.

Most things get fixed, so now it just does the following :

+ Includes proxy server for APM that I can toggle on as off on port 33133.  
  This is to work around https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7191.  
  To use press CTRL-SHIFT-P and type "proxy" (start/stop).
+ Bundle my favorite fonts for whatever environment I use Atom in.
+ Fix issues with bundled font alignment.
+ Backup my Atom config.

My bundled fonts are as follows :

| In settings | Will map to |
| --- | --- |
|camingo|CamingoCode|
|courier prime|Courier Prime Source|
|cutive|Cutive Mono|
|hack|Hack|
|inconsolata|Inconsolata-Regular|
|liberation|LiberationMono-Regular|
|pt|PT_Mono|
|roboto|Roboto Mono|
|roboto light|Roboto Mono Light|
|roboto thin|Roboto Mono Thin|
|srcpro|SourceCodePro-Regular|
|ubuntu|UbuntuMono-Regular|

Maybe someone else finds this useful :-)

Thanks for reading
