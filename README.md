# John's Atom Workarounds

This plugin fixed issues that I knew about in the Atom editor.

I love Atom, but could not live with the issues while working on my code.

So I created this plugin to solve most of the issues I had in one place.

But over time most got fixed, so now it just does the following :

+ Bundle my favorite fonts for whatever environment I use Atom in.
+ Fix issues with bundled font alignment.
+ Backup my Atom config.

Bundled fonts are as follows :

| In settings | Will map to |
| --- | --- |
|camingo|CamingoCode|
|courier prime|Courier Prime Source|
|cutive|Cutive Mono|
|hack|Hack|
|inconsolata|Inconsolata-Regular|
|liberation|LiberationMono-Regular|
|pt|PT_Mono|
|roboto|Roboto Mono|
|srcpro|SourceCodePro-Regular|
|ubuntu|UbuntuMono-Regular|

Maybe someone else finds this useful :-)
