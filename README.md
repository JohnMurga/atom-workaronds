# John's Atom Workarounds

I love Atom, but could not live with the issues while working on my code.  
So I created this plugin to solve most of the issues I have in one place.

Most things get fixed, so now it just does the following :

+ Bundle my favorite fonts for whatever environment I use Atom in.
+ Fix intermittent issues with font alignment.
+ Backups my Atom config.

My bundled fonts are as follows :

| In settings | Will map to |
| --- | --- |
|camingo|Camingo Code|
|consola|Consola Monop|
|inconsolata|Inconsolata-Regular|
|ocp-light|OfficeCodePro-Light|
|ocp-regular|OfficeCodePro-Regular|
|pt|PT Mono|
|roboto-light|Roboto Mono Light|
|roboto-regular|Roboto Mono Regular|

Maybe someone else finds this useful

Thanks for reading :smiley:
